# Hi, I'm Carl

I'm a plant-powered ðŸŒ± dad, cyclist ðŸš´ and software (iOS) engineer ðŸ’».

I've been a dish-washer, a vehicle mechanic and a software developer.

<!-- 
## School

I went to Inverkeithing High School. I did not enjoy my time there.

## Vehicle Mechanic

<!-- I was a bit lost -->

I started my apprenticeship in 1997, working as a mechanic on-and-off until 2007.

I was mostly working on older vehicles, mainly because newer vehicles didn't need much work for a good few years, and people tended to keep cars for longer back then.

The vehicles I worked on could be from the early '80s up to mid '90s. These were very different from the cars of today.

The garage that I served my time at (Forth Auto Electrics), was a small family run business in Fife, Scotland.

There was the owner and his two sons, his brother, and his brother's son.

The owner and his sons were all auto electricians. The owner's brother and his son were general mechanics. I joined the mechanical side of the business.

## Software Development

### Education

My first coding experience was back in the mid '80s when I learned to change the screen colour on my Amstrad CPC-464 with keyboards commands.

Throughout my teenage years I did a lot of playing around with computers, building them, reinstalling Windows (many, many time)s, and had a general interest in how they worked, but I didn't have a strong feeling that I would ever get into the software side of things. That seemed like a thing that smart people did who did well at school.

In 2007 I started a one-year HNC (Higher National Certificate) in Computing at Edinburgh Telford College. This was a general computing course to help you find the area(s) that you were interested in to then go on to further study.

I had no idea what I was going to do after this course, but I knew I needed a change from mechanics.

Towards the end of the course most of my classmates were applying for university. I had never considered university before and I wasn't sure if it was for me - I had dropped out of high school at the age of 16 with no qualifications, dismayed by education.

I decided to apply for university as I didn't have any idea what else I would do. I didn't expect that a HNC in Computing would open up many opportunities for work.

I was accepted for a place at Edinburgh Napier University on their BSc Computing course. This was a four-year course with options for different modules throughout the course. I chose to take modules related to mobile app development as this interested me more than the other options.

These modules focussed more on Android more than iOS, presumably because of the costs involved with requiring Apple Mac's and Apple Developer accounts for iOS development. I gave Android development a go for a week or two before getting so frustrated with the maze of dependencies that I asked if I could pass the module doing iOS development instead - to which they agreed, and this began my iOS development journey.

## Career

I've been a developing iOS apps professionally since 2013.

### NN4M

I began my career with NN4M (No Need 4 Mirrors), a young Edinburgh based mobile app agency specialising in transactional retail apps.

When I graduated uni I still didn't feel ready to get into the world of software development. I went back to working in my old garage for a while as I needed to earn some money, and they would always take me back as they were quite busy and struggled to find good mechanics that would fit with their workplace environment.

I lived in Edinburgh at the time and I remember using my train journey home as thinking time, and at this time I was really contemplating what I was going to do. Would I end up staying as a mechanic full-time? would I start up my own garage? Then very serendipitously, I received a text message from my college friend, Pete - he said that his workplace (NN4M) was looking for iOS developers and that he could refer me.

I was nervous about it, but I knew I had to give it a go.
I hadn't done much iOS dev lately, so was pretty rusty.
I went in for the interview, suited up to the max!
I felt like it went pretty well. Although I probably charmed them more with my suit and big smile, than with my software engineering knowledge.

I then got a take-home tech test to do, to make an app that would fetch a list of items and display them in a list. This was a feature that basically all of their apps had for displaying lists of products for sale that you can then tap on to see more detail.

I think I took at least a week, maybe more, to complete it. I managed to buy more time with some excuse I don't remember now.
