Hi, I'm Carl.

I'm a plant-powered ðŸŒ± dad, cyclist ðŸš´ and software (iOS) engineer ðŸ’».

I've been a developing iOS apps professionally since 2013.

Pre-software dev I was a vehicle technician.

My first memory of being fascinated with computers was back in the mid '80s when I learned to change the screen colour on my Amstrad CPC-464 using keyboards commands.
I also have strangely fond memories of playing a game about house mortgages on the computer.

Feel free to browse around and find out a bit more about me, or [get in touch](mailto: {{ site.social.email }} ).
