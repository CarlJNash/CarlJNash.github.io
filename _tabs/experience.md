## PROFILE

<div style="margin-left: 20px;" markdown=1>

As you may have read in my [about](./about.md) page, my previous career was as a vehicle mechanic.

### Beginning

My dev career started in 2013 when I got my first break as a graduate iOS developer at [NN4M](#nn4m-no-need-4-mirrors--ios-engineer--apr-2013---oct-2017).

Since then I've progressed from grad, to junior, to senior, and also dabbled with lead developer roles.

### Sectors

I've worked in a few different sectors; including retail, digital health, fintech and most recently social networking.

I've worked as a solo developer, on small 1-3 dev teams, and in larger 30+ dev teams.

### Strengths

My strengths lie in being a good all-round software engineer and team member. I don't concern myself with being the "smartest" developer in the room that can write the cleverest algorithms in a one-liner, or abstract the heck out of a networking layer to make it work for every possible scenario at the cost of readability and maintainability.

If I had to pick some words to describe myself as a software engineer, I'd say:

- Pragmatic
  - Understanding when to use a tactical or a strategic approach to get the work done, depending on the needs of the client and the team at the time.
    - Strategic: If we need to implement an important new feature that is going to be a big part of a future release, then this probably requires a strategic approach to plan it out and ensure that users have the best experience when first using the feature and we won't need to be shipping regular updates and hot-fixes to resolve issues once it's out in the wild.
    - Tactical: If users are experiencing an issue with the app or we're getting a lot of negative feedback about a feature and we need to resolve this quickly, then this probably requires a tactical approach to get a quick fix out that improves the situation quickly, while we work on a more refined long-term solution.
- Wholistic
  - Look at the bigger picture \<COMPLETE THIS>
